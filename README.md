# ColorPick

Hello and welcome to my first game made using flutter.

So in this game we basically have to pick the color mentioned. If we pick the correct color within the a timeframe of 1.5 seconds, our score increases by 1 point. 
If we pick the wrong color the game ends with a message - "Wrong Color". 
If we don't pick the correct color within the timeframe the game end with a message - "Time Exceeded"

Thanks!
